// Data retention (Tier 0 T0-9, 2026-08-18; YouTube refresh Tier 1.5,
// 2026-08-22). Until Tier 0 nothing in the product ever deleted source data:
// `video_raw` held whole actor payloads (Instagram owner names, tagged users
// with profile pictures, location names, TikTok POI latitude/longitude) that
// only the transcribe step reads and nothing prunes; `ai_call_log.request` held
// every prompt, comment text included, forever; and YouTube rows older than 30
// days were never refreshed or purged, which the YouTube API Services Developer
// Policy (III.E.4.d) does not allow.
//
// The privacy notice states these windows, so this cron is what makes the
// statement true. Runs 04:00 SAST, before the owned-snapshot and pipeline crons.
//
// Steps (ids are a stability contract — see AGENTS.md):
//   1. purge-video-raw            — raw payloads past 30 days: deleted.
//   2. strip-ai-call-bodies       — prompt/response bodies past 30 days: nulled.
//   3. refresh-youtube-comments   — comments 25+ days since last read: re-fetched
//                                   from the API (III.E.4.d "delete OR refresh").
//                                   Deleted/hidden on YouTube → deleted here,
//                                   evidence cascades, hero_quote copies nulled.
//                                   Edited → updated, non-verifying quotes dropped.
//   4. refresh-youtube-videos     — video statistics likewise; a video the API
//                                   no longer returns is tombstoned (never
//                                   deleted: videos(id) cascades into the whole
//                                   analysis) and its comments deleted.
//   5. purge-stale-youtube-comments — the BACKSTOP: anything still unrefreshed
//                                   at 30 days (five failed nights) takes the
//                                   shared delete path — uncited deleted (stored
//                                   exports quoting them staled), cited lose
//                                   `author`. It should delete nothing on a
//                                   healthy night; if it does, refresh is failing.
//
// Deliberately conservative: nothing analytical is deleted on any platform
// except YouTube rows YouTube itself no longer serves. Comment text and
// insights live for the life of the workspace, which is what the notice says.
// Preview: `node --env-file=.env.local --import tsx scripts/retention-dry.ts`.
