# Repo rules

- **Verify claims against code and DB, not docs or notes.** Shipped-state
  comments and older docs drift; the code is the record.
- **Inngest step IDs are a stability contract.** Completed steps replay by ID
  string; renaming/renumbering strands in-flight runs across a deploy. Change
  step shape only between runs, and re-register after function changes:
  `curl -X PUT https://app.verbatimintel.com/api/inngest`.
- **A new step is an additive id in its own position** — never a rename, a
  renumber or a reorder. Two landed 2026-09-15: `embed-insights` (after the
  Pass A wave, before `cross-reference`) and `freeze-months` (after
  `persist-themes`, before `owned-events`). Both are non-fatal — logged, not
  `noteError`'d, the `keyword-discovery` precedent — because a record kept
  alongside the report must not make a clean run read `partial`; and both
  no-op rather than retry when their migration has not been applied yet.
- **A run's window is frozen once, at `open-run`** (`pipeline_runs.window_start`
  / `window_end` / `window_basis`, rule in `lib/pipeline/window.ts`). Steps read
  it off `OpenRunResult` / `GatherOptions`; no step recomputes the window from
  `Date.now()` — three did, and two multi-day runs gathered and synthesised
  against windows 18 and 9 days apart. Instagram and YouTube take the dates;
  TikTok and Reddit take enums (`tiktokRangeFor` / `redditTimeFor`) and the
  `inWindow` post-filter trims the surplus.
- **Tests are offline, in two tiers** (vitest — no network, DB, or GPT).
  `lib/**/*.test.ts` is pure logic: new pure pipeline logic gets a test, and
  don't mock the world to test I/O glue. `components/**/*.test.tsx` is the
  render tier: one static `renderToStaticMarkup` per block (`lib/test/render.ts`)
  asserted against the copy contract (`lib/test/copy-contract.ts` — no digit in
  a model-prose node, every level prints "of N", no direction word outside a
  verdict node, marked with `data-copy="prose|figure|level|verdict"`). Every
  block gets one. No jsdom, no testing-library, no new dependency: the tier
  checks what a block PRINTS.
- **The build runs in CI, and in a worktree it needs a flag.** `npm run build`
  fails inside a git worktree — `node_modules` is a symlink out of the project
  root and Turbopack will not resolve through it. Use `npx next build --webpack`
  (also `next dev --webpack`), or `TURBOPACK_ROOT=<dir holding both> npx next
  build` for production parity; `next.config.ts` reads that env var and is inert
  without it. CI builds with Turbopack, the bundler Vercel uses, because that is
  the only gate that catches a bundler-only break before a deploy does.
- **`next.config.ts` declares no redirects.** Config-level redirects run BEFORE
  `proxy.ts`, which is what routes the apex between the marketing site and the
  app by host. A redirect added here silently wins over that routing; send it
  through the proxy instead.
- **Insights belong to videos, not runs (incremental Pass A, 2026-08-17).**
  `videos.analyzed_run_id` names the run whose `audience_insights` /
  `language_samples` rows are a video's current analysis. Population reads
  ("all current insights") go through the `audience_insights_current` /
  `language_samples_current` views — never `audience_insights … eq('run_id')`
  (that means "produced by this run", which is only what
  `keyword-attribution.ts` wants). Id-set lookups (by `audience_insight_id`)
  stay on the base tables so they resolve rows an in-flight run has superseded
  but not yet pruned. A Pass A prompt-version bump re-reads the whole corpus
  on the next run — that is the cost of a change, budget for it.
- **Theme identity lives in `theme_registry`.** `themes.id` is a per-run row id
  (the table is fully replaced each run) and must NEVER be used as a cross-run
  key; `themes.registry_id` is the stable identity, and cross-run joins use it.
  Do not join themes by `label` — labels churn ~88% run to run because a
  reasoning model writes them and reasoning models take no temperature.
- **A period is dated by the comment, never by the run.** `run_id` / `run_date`
  are a run's own bookkeeping and are never a period key outside `run_summary`
  (`theme_observations.run_date` is the wall clock at persist — one run has
  carried two dates). The series is per calendar month by `comments.comment_date`
  through `lib/reading/monthly.ts` into `month_denominators` /
  `month_theme_readings` — which exist once `20260915092000_monthly_reading.sql`
  is applied AND the tables are seeded, not before; a fresh database has the
  code and no rows, and every reader has to survive that. (Production: applied
  and seeded 2026-09-15 — 214 denominator months, 2,872 theme readings, both
  tenants.) A month is `filling` until 30 days after it ends and `frozen` after;
  a frozen row is never rewritten — a BEFORE UPDATE trigger per table
  (`month_denominators_frozen_guard`, `month_theme_readings_frozen_guard`, both
  running `month_reading_frozen_guard()`) refuses it, so a late-discovered video
  shows as accrual and no artefact is silently corrected. Two limits come with that, and a reader has to
  carry them: months freeze under whatever clustering was current when each
  passed its line, so rows of different months may carry different `run_id`s and
  a cross-month comparison is like-for-like only where `run_id` is equal; and
  `audience` is a NAME (`competitor:<competitor_name>`, free text from Settings),
  so renaming a rival splits its series — the frozen months stay under the old
  string and cannot be re-keyed.
- **Every configuration write carries an actor.** `tracking_configs` UPDATEs go
  through `updateWithActor` / `withActor` (`lib/config-log.ts`) so the
  `tracking_configs_audit` trigger logs a person instead of a role; surfaces the
  trigger cannot see (schedules, subjects, an entity re-tag, a re-gate) call
  `recordConfigChange(s)`. Operator scripts pass `scriptActor('<the command>')`,
  the pipeline `pipelineActor(runId, …)`; hand-run SQL is caught by the trigger
  alone. A browser's stamp is never taken on trust — kind, user and label come
  from identity, and `operator` survives only for a `platform_admins` row.
- **The Supabase client is untyped** (no `Database` generic). Reads past 1000
  rows must use `selectAll` (`lib/supabase-admin.ts`) — a bare `.select()`
  silently caps at 1000.
- **Client-facing copy is calibrated**: no pipeline jargon (T#, Pass C, run),
  no raw scores; "comments" vs "conversations" have fixed meanings
  (`lib/calibration.ts` GLOSSARY). Copy claims about behavior must match the
  code (a page once claimed "no email is sent" while Resend sent).
- **No direction word on the run-indexed series** (`directionWordsFor(reader)`
  in `lib/config.ts`, all seven readers false since 2026-09-15). Gaining /
  fading / New compares two readings of one cumulative corpus taken at two
  arbitrary moments, not two periods — a missed week moves the number as much
  as the conversation does. One flag PER READER (`voice.movers`,
  `dashboard.themes`, `documents.trajectory`, `agent.movement`, `initiatives`,
  `competitive.deltas`, `profile.mix`) so a reader flips the day its own series
  is re-based on the monthly reading and not before; never read the map
  directly. Gated branches read the flag instead of deleting the code and gated
  pure functions take it as an argument, so both answers stay tested. A CHART is
  a direction claim too — `profile.mix` gates a line across `run_date` that
  printed no direction word at all. Levels are untouched, as is any period
  reading with an n and a band (the digest's sentiment and share verdicts).
- **Costs are real**: gather scripts spend Apify money; synthesis calls spend
  OpenAI. Prefer inspectors/dry-run flags (`run-relevance.ts`, `--no-merge`,
  send-report's default preview) when iterating.
- `.env.local` holds real production credentials — never commit it, never
  print its values into logs or command output.
- **Exports and reports freeze numbers, never words.** A snapshot
  (`report_snapshots.data`) holds tile-ready data with every quote as a ref
  (`lib/renderables/quotes-freeze.ts`) and `text: ''`; the words resolve at
  render. Nothing under `lib/reports/` may store or send to a model a
  comment's text — the cover prompt gets figure KEYS and validated brief
  prose only. A share link (`/r/<token>`) reads the link, its snapshot and
  the quote texts — never a tenant table live. A scheduled send
  (`report_sends`) stores subject, recipients and ids — never the email body;
  "the email as sent" re-renders from the snapshot. `weekly_reports` is
  legacy (read-only, stored HTML) and gets no new rows.
- **Rendering never runs inside an Inngest step.** Chromium (PDF, PNG) and
  the email body are produced in route handlers (`/api/export`,
  `/api/reports/[id]/build`, `/api/admin/schedules/run`, `/api/schedules/*`,
  `/api/admin/documents/render`); an Inngest function only `fetch`es them,
  one step per schedule or build (`build-document`'s own steps are model
  calls and a snapshot insert, nothing else). The account
  has a hard 5-slot concurrency shared with the pipeline. `react-dom/server`
  cannot be imported statically in an app route (Next compiles it in the RSC
  layer) — `lib/email/render-html.ts` loads it at runtime; new browser or
  email routes need their `outputFileTracingIncludes` entry.
