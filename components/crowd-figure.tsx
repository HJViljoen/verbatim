// One figure from the crowd, drawn large.
//
// The geometry is lifted verbatim from the front tier (stroke-opacity 1.000) of
// public/crowd.svg and normalised to head-centre x=0, head-top y=0. Five real
// bodies, so a persona switcher changes silhouette without anyone inventing a
// shape — these are the same people already standing in the background of every
// page.
//
// Why not reuse the asset: crowd.svg has no ids or classes to target, is used
// as a CSS background-image on three surfaces, and hard-codes its ink stroke so
// it cannot follow the dark theme. Inline SVG is the house pattern for every
// chart here anyway (no chart libraries — DESIGN rule), and it themes, scales
// and gives the evidence blocks real coordinates to point at.
//
// Drawn as a filled cream body with a deep-green outline while the backdrop
// crowd stays in thin line: the page's subject should read as a person standing
// in FRONT of the crowd — solid enough to occlude it — not as one more outline
// lost in it.

// Figure d (front #13) is deliberately absent: it is the narrow, short,
// asymmetric one, and next to these four it reads as a different species
// rather than a different person. The set has to look like one crowd.
