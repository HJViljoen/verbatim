// Inngest endpoint. Inngest Cloud calls this route (GET to sync, PUT to
// register, POST to invoke) using its own signing-key auth — it carries no
// Supabase session, so `proxy.ts` excludes this path from the auth redirect.

// The pipeline runs gather + several GPT passes, but Inngest invokes this route
// once per step (each step returns quickly), so a single invocation never needs
// long. Capped at 300s for the Hobby plan; raise toward 800 on Pro if a single
// step ever needs it.
