// The Guide (component-map §4b): one section per page — what it tells you,
// how to read it, what to do with it each week, what it can't tell you. The
// "how to read it" definitions are the calibrated GLOSSARY in
// lib/calibration.ts, the same source the "How to read this page" pills use,
// so there is one wording for every label. Every behavioural claim here must
// match the code (AGENTS.md); when in doubt this page says less, not more.
