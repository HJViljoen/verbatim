 * Supabase auth code exchange (fresh-eyes review, 2026-08-18).
 *
 * The password-reset flow shipped without this and could never complete:
 * `@supabase/ssr`'s createServerClient defaults to PKCE, so the emailed
 * recovery link returns to the app with a `code` query parameter, and nothing
 * consumed it. `/reset/confirm` therefore always found no session and told
 * every user their link had expired.
 *
 * This route exchanges the code for a session (writing the auth cookies) and
 * forwards to wherever the link was headed.
