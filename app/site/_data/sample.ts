// Illustrative market used across the marketing site: a hiking-backpack
// category with fictional brands (Northline, Ridgeway, Trailform, Cairnline).
// Numbers are consistent across every section that shows them, because the
// product's promise is that the same fact reads the same everywhere. Nothing
// here is a client, a testimonial or a real brand. Copy contract:
// .agents/product-marketing.md.
//
// THE SITE SAYS SO (finish-list item 25): a bag brand read the home page's
// backpack market as its own data, or as a claim about someone's. The notes
// below label the example on each page, and every mock panel's caption starts
// with "Example market". The one measured figure on the site, 4 brand mentions
// in 18,440 comments (.agents/product-marketing.md, "Proof points"), is NOT
// from this market, and the home page says so right where the example starts.
//
// UNITS ARE THE PRODUCT'S (AGENTS.md, "New reading surfaces say videos"): a
// theme, a profile and a brand are counted in videos, a level carries its
// "of N", and nothing carries a direction word (gaining, fading, emerging, an
// up or down arrow): the product reports levels, and compares months only once
// they compare.
