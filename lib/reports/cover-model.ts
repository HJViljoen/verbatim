/**

 * sentences in the reader's register over a figure TABLE — keys and labels,
 * never values — and the executive brief's already-validated prose. It may
 * only cite a figure by `[[key]]`; the code writes the number in at render.
 * What reaches the model: the audience, the title, the section titles, the
 * brief's headline and beats, the figure labels. No quote, no comment, no
 * name of a person — so a cover is not something erasure has to chase.
 *
 * Logged to ai_call_log as pass 'report_cover' with the model named
 * explicitly (logAiCall defaults to ANALYSIS_MODEL). Any failure — API, parse,
 * everything scrubbed — falls back to the code cover; a build never waits on
 * or fails for this call.
