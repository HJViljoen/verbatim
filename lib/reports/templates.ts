 * The four starters (spec §5). A template only ARRANGES pages the pipeline
 * already produces and sets the cover register — never new analysis. Keys are
 * the pages' static renderables (components/pages/<page>/index.tsx); a key the
 * registry does not know is dropped at build time with a warning, so a
 * renamed tile degrades a template rather than breaking it.
 *
 * Kept in code, not rows: versioned with the pages they name. A tenant's own
 * arrangement is the workspace's own template — a reports row (Stage 3).
