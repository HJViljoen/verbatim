/**
 * The researcher's questions (pure). Fixed anchors first, the register's
 * question when the reader sells through professionals or shops, one per
 * included competitor, then the update's loudest concerns until the cap.
 * Anchors outnumber the data-driven questions on purpose: the brief reads
 * the same way each week because it asks the same things each week, and the
 * week's own concerns add to that, they do not replace it.
 *
 * The cap RISES to fit the anchors (WP7d, 2026-09-12). `max` sized the four
 * fixed templates, whose anchors have always fitted inside it; a composed
 * template asks its selected topic blocks' questions too, and a block "that
 * must be included" (Heinrich, 2026-08-30) is not included if its questions
 * are sliced off the end. So no anchor is ever dropped: the update's own
 * concerns are what yields, as they already did. The real ceiling stays the
 * build's dollar budget, which the picker is sized against
 * (templates.affordableBlocks).
