/**
 * Document templates: a ROLE the agent writes as, a standing BRIEF, the fixed
 * SKELETON, and the researcher's ANCHOR questions. Kept in code, versioned
 * with the writer's prompt. A template arranges nothing; it says who is
 * writing, for whom, and what shape the answer takes.
 *
 * The skeleton is fixed on purpose (Heinrich, 2026-08-30): every issue of a
 * brief reads like the last one, so "what changed" is comparable and the
 * reader learns where things are. The writer fills blocks; it never adds or
 * drops a page.
 *
 * Four templates (2026-09-02). The Sales brief is the reference and its
 * output is unchanged; the other three are the same engine pointed at another
 * reader. What actually differs between them is small and deliberate: the
 * role and brief, the LENS (what a finding's consequence is called), the
 * skeleton's middle pages, and the anchors. Everything else — the finding
 * floor, the ordering by evidence, the confidence, the figure table, the
 * method page, the scrub — is the product's, not the template's.
