/**
 * The research job: the researcher's questions, asked of the Consumer
 * Intelligence Agent one wave at a time. Each answer keeps the agent's own
 * sentences (grounded points, with the insight ids and conversation counts
 * the engine computed), the judgement, and the quotes AS REFS with their
 * words kept only in memory for the picker; nothing here is stored. The
 * engine's calls go to ai_call_log (persist: true), no thread is written.
 *
 * Two errors are not answers: a workspace with no searchable index (the
 * agent's own distinct message) blocks the build, and a run that has not
 * completed does too. Anything else marks that one question failed and the
 * others go on: a brief with six answers beats no brief.
