 * The cover (Stage 2, spec §4): a few sentences in the reader's register over
 * figures the code computed. The prose carries `[[figure_key]]` placeholders;
 * the numbers are written in at render from the frozen figure table — the
 * same rule as composeDashboardNarrative's [[n]], with named keys because a
 * cover may cite several. A key the table does not hold drops its sentence.
 *
 * The model half (generateCover) lives in lib/reports/cover-model.ts so this
 * file stays pure and tested; when the model is unavailable or its prose is
 * unusable, composeFallbackCover writes the cover in code. A build never
 * waits on, or fails for, the model.
