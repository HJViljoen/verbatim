// Pass A — per-video analysis (Architecture/Analysis-Passes §Pass A), built in
// code per Architecture/Migration-to-Code. One GPT call per video that clears
// the platform's kept-comment floor (config.passAMinComments): classification + audience insights, each insight carrying verbatim
// evidence tied to a real comment. Validated post-parse and persisted to
// videos / audience_insights / insight_evidence, with one ai_call_log row.
//
// v4 (transcripts on): the video's transcript grounds classification on every
// bucket; industry-other transcripts are quotable evidence (label "t", stored
// source='video'); client/competitor transcripts yield brand claims →
// video_claims. Brand-voice vs customer-voice — design 2026-08-08.
//
// Budget note: $2.40 OpenAI ceiling — iterate with `dryRun` (free) and small
// `limit`/`videoIds` samples; only run the full corpus once the prompt is dialed.

// v3.1 / v4.1 (2026-08-22): demographic_signal is counted, not quoted — the
// category definition drops "age" and a rule keeps identity disclosures out of
// every other quote. A version bump re-reads the corpus on the next run when
// INCREMENTAL_PASS_A is on; that is the cost of a prompt change (AGENTS.md).
// DELIBERATELY NOT BUMPED for the 2026-09-11 classified_type/hook_style
// definitions, and that is a decision, not an oversight.
//
// Bumping re-reads every eligible video on the next run. For Sealand that is
// thousands of videos of real OpenAI spend, landing unannounced on whichever
// run happens to go next — Össur's Sunday, most likely. Whether to pay to
// re-label the back catalogue is Heinrich's call to make deliberately, not a
// side effect of a prompt edit.
//
// The cost of NOT bumping, stated plainly so it is not discovered later:
// videos analysed before this change keep labels the model chose when it was
// given bare enum names, videos analysed after get labels chosen against the
// definitions, and nothing on any surface distinguishes the two. Content's
// hook_style comparison averages both regimes. classify-meta is stricter still
// — it only picks up videos where classified_type IS NULL, so those labels do
// not change until someone nulls the column.
//
// To re-label deliberately: bump BOTH constants below (a transcripts-disabled
// tenant books against PROMPT_VERSION, so bumping only the v4 one would leave
// those tenants un-re-read) and run with INCREMENTAL_PASS_A on, knowing it
// re-reads the corpus once.
