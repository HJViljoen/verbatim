// Pass E — the consumer profile. One call per run, after Pass D.
//
// Everything else in the pipeline analyses WHAT is being said. This answers WHO
// is saying it: a small set of personas over the run's current insight
// population, each one a grouping of counted insights with its own evidence.
//
// Two things it is deliberately NOT. It is not a customer database — no
// commenter identity ever reaches a model (Pass A sends comment text alone), so
// a persona describes the conversation, not people we have identified. And it
// is not a character sheet: the model proposes and cites, code grounds and
// drops (persona-assembly.ts). The product contract bans invented personas, so
// a proposal that cannot be grounded is worth less than one fewer persona.
//
// Non-fatal by construction: the pipeline runs this as its own Inngest step
// with .catch(), so a client's report never dies for a profile.

// v2 (2026-08-19, Heinrich's design review): the personas were named like
// themes ("the identity-led wearer seeking confidence") and the blocks listed
// what people asked for rather than describing what they are like. A profile
// page is a character sketch — the specifics belong on Voice and Market, one
// click away. Names are now short human nouns; blocks are characterisations.
// v3 (2026-08-19): continuity. The cast persists across runs — shown to the
// model as the default answer, and carried by evidence overlap afterwards so it
// holds whether or not the model cooperates.
// v4 (2026-08-19): the blocks are written analysis, not bullets. This page is a
// read, not a dataset — same register as the dashboard's executive brief.
