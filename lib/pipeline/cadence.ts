// Cadence reliability (Tier 2, 2026-08-18).
//
// The product is sold as a weekly update, and nothing measured whether the
// weekly update actually arrived. Measured on the live corpus when this was
// written: Össur had 10 completed-or-partial runs and 2 emailed reports. A run
// that finishes and emails nobody looks identical, in every dashboard and every
// log, to one that finishes and delivers.
//
// The distinction that makes this usable: a run only OWES a report if it was
// dispatched with sendReport. Sealand is the internal iteration tenant and the
// demo is seeded — both finish runs and email nobody entirely on purpose, and
// an alert that cannot tell those from a real miss is an alert nobody reads.
// pipeline_runs.options records sendReport as of the T1 flag snapshot.
