// Pass C — competitive analysis (Architecture/Analysis-Passes §Pass C). Single
// GPT call over Step A2's bucketed themes (never re-reads raw comments). Finds
// what only emerges from cross-bucket comparison: topic ownership, content gaps,
// competitive threats, sentiment differentials. Themes are presented as short
// indices (T1, T2 …); the model references those, and code maps them back to
// audience_insights UUIDs, rejecting unknown indices (invariant 8). On a
// single-bucket corpus there is nothing to compare, so the model returns [].

// v4 (2026-07-04): calibrated language — prose rule (no intensity/frequency
// words; cross-bucket comparisons stay allowed, they're this pass's job) + an
// anti-inflation guard on impact_level (the 3 Jul run rated 3 of 5 "high").
// v5 (2026-08-08, Step 2b): competitor claims from video transcripts enter as
// CONTEXT (claims block) — findings still cite themes only.
// v6 (2026-09-15, Phase 0 D2): those claims are split by who was speaking. The
// own-videos block now carries only the rival's own voice, and what creators
// and reviewers say ABOUT a rival arrives in its own labelled block instead of
// being read as that rival's marketing (206 of Sealand's 208 rows were).
