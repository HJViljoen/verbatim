/**
 * Schedules (Reports & Exports Stage 3, 2026-08-30).

 * A schedule names WHAT to send — a starter template by key, or one of the
 * workspace's own templates (a `reports` row) — WHEN (after every scheduled
 * update, or the first update of each month) and TO WHOM (its own list).
 * Firing one produces an ordinary report snapshot, a PDF artifact and a share
 * link, and a `report_sends` row that records ids and timestamps — never the
 * email body (words stay live in the snapshot, as everywhere on the spine).
