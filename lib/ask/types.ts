// The Ask engine's contract.
//
// THREE REGISTERS, and the separation is structural rather than a flag:
//
//   ClaimResult   GROUNDED. A verdict, a count, the themes and insight ids
//                 behind it. Nothing in here is the model's opinion.
//   Judgement     THE MODEL'S OWN PROPOSAL, marked as such and citing the claim
//                 refs it reasons from. It may propose, infer and recommend
//                 freely — it may not pose as evidence.
//   'silent'      A FIRST-CLASS VERDICT. "The conversation does not speak to
//                 this" is an answer, not a gap to fill.
//
// A flag on one list would let a careless render merge them; separate types
// mean the grounded panel cannot accidentally print a proposal.
