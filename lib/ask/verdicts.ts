// rather than labels alone — label-only matching under-recalls badly once the

 * The rules that are ENFORCED, not trusted:
 * - A verdict for a claim that was not asked about is dropped.
 * - One verdict per claim; the first wins.
 * - `silent` carries no audience voice and no themes. The model saying
 *   "silent" and then quoting the audience is the model contradicting itself,
 *   and the silent reading is the conservative one.
 * - A non-silent verdict with no `they_say`, or whose themes all failed to
 *   resolve, becomes `silent`. This is the reverse contract: a claim the model
 *   asserted but could not ground is untested, not supported.
 * - **A non-silent verdict must have at least one real comment behind it.**
 *   Without this the register is only structurally grounded: the verdict, the
 *   count and the theme ids are all checked, while `theySay` — the sentence the
 *   reader actually reads — is free prose. Requiring a quotable insight means a
 *   claim can only be reported as supported or contradicted when a person
 *   really did say something, and the page can show it.
 * - Cited evidence is intersected with the insights that STILL EXIST. Themes
 *   outlive their insights (prune-stale-analysis), so a check re-evaluated
 *   against an older run would otherwise count rows that are gone.
 * - Counts are distinct SOURCE VIDEOS of the surviving cited insights — a
 *   conversation is one video and the comments written under it that month. The theme's own
 *   total breadth is not the claim's evidence.
