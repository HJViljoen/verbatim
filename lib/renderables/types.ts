 * The spine of Reports & Exports (Stage 1, 2026-08-29).

 * Every dashboard page is a LOADER (`load(scope) → data`, one per page, the
 * DB waves kept exactly as the page had them — round trips cost more than
 * rows, 2026-08-23) and a set of RENDERERS (`render(data, mode)`, pure, one per
 * tile or item). The same data feeds the app page, the print route that Chrome
 * turns into PDF/PNG, and — later — the Studio, email and the agent.
 *
 * Data is TILE-READY: the shape the renderers consume, after lib/*-tiles.ts
 * has done its work. That is what a snapshot stores (report_snapshots.data),
 * so an export renders the same numbers in October that it rendered in
 * August, whatever the `*_current` views say by then.
