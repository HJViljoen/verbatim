/**
 * Freeze and thaw the quotes inside tile-ready page data.
 *
 * A snapshot stores numbers and ids, never a third party's words. `freezeQuotes`
 * walks any data structure, empties the `text` of every Quote it finds and
 * collects their refs (report_snapshots.evidence_ids — the column erase-commenter
 * searches). `resolveQuotes` walks the same structure with the texts fetched
 * live and puts the words back; a quote whose ref no longer resolves is DROPPED
 * from its array (or nulled where it stood alone), which is how an erased
 * comment disappears from an export rendered after the erasure.
 *
 * A Quote is recognised structurally: an object whose `ref` is a string of the
 * form `e:…`, `c:…`, `v:…` or `h:<table>:…` and whose `text` is a string.
 * Nothing else in the pages uses that shape, and the prefix is what keeps this
 * from being a guess. `h:` is a HERO quote — the pipeline's copy of a voice on
 * a recommendations / market_insights / competitive_insights / account_events
 * row (`hero_quote`), which erase-commenter nulls by string match, so resolving
 * through the row is as erasure-safe as resolving through insight_evidence.
 * `b:<run_id>:<n>` is a "said about you" claim quoted from a VIDEO
 * (run_summary.brand_voice.about[n].quote — a creator's words, not a
 * commenter's; kept as a ref all the same so no stored export carries them).
 * `m:<comments.id>` is a comment AS POSTED (the reply inbox shows the whole
 * comment, not the evidence excerpt); it resolves only while an evidence row
 * still cites it, so erasure and redaction reach it the same way.
 * `p:<language_samples.id>` is a customer PHRASE (Voice's "how your customers
 * talk") — a commenter's words with a comment_id behind them, cascade-deleted
 * on erasure like evidence rows.
