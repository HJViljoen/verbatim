//
// THE ONE RULE, and the reason these are separate keys rather than a flag on a
// single list: access is not authority. The agent may read every layer of the
// corpus, but a GROUNDED point must be traceable to insights the pipeline
// already extracted and verified, while anything the agent worked out for
// itself belongs in JUDGEMENT. A flag can be dropped in a render; a key cannot.
//
// The failure this contract guards against in BOTH directions:
//   - a proposal wearing an evidence badge (bluffing), and
//   - a real finding suppressed because it did not perfectly resolve (FALSE
//     SILENCE). Enforcement therefore DEMOTES rather than drops.
