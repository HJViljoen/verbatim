// Where "no proof is ever created by the bot" stops being a principle and
// becomes code.
//
// The model proposes; this decides what the client is allowed to see as
// evidence. Nothing here trusts a returned field: ids are checked against rows
// that were actually retrieved, counts are recomputed, quotes are attached from
// the retrieved evidence rather than from anything the model wrote.
//
// NO EVIDENCE FLOOR, and this is a decision, not an omission (Heinrich,
// 2026-08-22). A grounded point backed by a single conversation is shown, with
// its count of 1 stated plainly beside it. Requiring two would hide real
// findings behind a rule and would be exactly the over-restriction that reads
// to a client as false silence. The product's answer to thin evidence is to
// SAY it is thin, not to withhold it. Heinrich: "no, don't put a floor, I
// think having it answer honestly like this is better." Do not add one without
// asking him.
//
// DEMOTE, NEVER DROP. A point whose ids do not resolve is not deleted — it
// moves to the judgement register, where it is honestly labelled as the agent's
// own reasoning. Deleting it would be over-restriction, and over-restriction
// shows up to a client as false silence: an answer suppressed when the corpus
// could have spoken. That is the worse failure of the two, and the rule that
// keeps it from happening lives here.
