// Reddit adapter (Wave 3). A subreddit post maps onto a "video" and its comment
// tree onto `comments`, so the whole gather → gate → Pass A–D spine works
// unchanged (Reddit has no views/shares — both 0 like Instagram; the videos.views column is NOT NULL).
//
// FETCH LAYER: Apify, not Reddit's own API. Reddit closed self-service API keys
// under the Nov-2025 Responsible Builder Policy, and unauthenticated public JSON
// 403s from datacenter IPs — verified dead again 2026-08-13, so do NOT re-attempt
// the free path. The actor is env-swappable (APIFY_ACTORS.reddit) because every
// Reddit actor is ToS-grey and may break: Reddit is a DEGRADABLE platform and its
// failure must never kill a run.
//
// FIELD PATHS: the actor renames raw Reddit JSON to camelCase, so nothing here
// matches Reddit's own field names. Confirmed against a live run 2026-08-13
// (harshmaur/reddit-scraper): `parsedId` is the bare post id ('1vln07j') while
// `id` carries the 't3_' fullname; `communityName` arrives already prefixed
// ('r/Prosthetics'); dates are ISO strings, not epochs; posts and comments share
// ONE dataset and are told apart by `dataType`.
//
// COST: the actor bills $0.02 per run START plus $0.002 per saved result, and the
// spine calls commentScrape once per video — so per-video init dominates on thin
// threads and depth dominates on fat ones. Comment depth is capped (see
// REDDIT_COMMENT_DEPTH_CAP) so one viral thread can't run up the bill.
