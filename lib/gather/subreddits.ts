// ---- Dead-community detection (Wave 3) --------------------------------------
//
// An active community stays active forever unless something demotes it. Real
// subreddits go private, get banned, or drift off-topic — and when one does, its
// harvest yields nothing EVERY run: the run closes 'partial' every week, no
// replacement is ever proposed (discovery has converged), and there is no
// operator surface to fix it.
//
// The hard part is that "this community died" and "our scraper broke" look
// identical from here. If the Apify actor breaks or Reddit changes, every
// community returns nothing at once — and a naive rule would demote all of them
// in a single run and wipe the tenant's config. So a community is only ever
// struck when its failure is COMMUNITY-SPECIFIC: some other Reddit source (a
// keyword search or another community) produced results in the same run, which
// is the evidence that our side of the pipe works.

/** Per-source gate survivors for one run, keyed exactly as keyword_performance
 *  stores them — a community harvest appears as 'r/amputee', a keyword as
 *  'ossur'. Null when the tenant has no Reddit gather history yet. */

 * rejection, while a community that was merely having a bad month goes straight
 * back to active. Marking it 'rejected' here would be permanent — rejects are
 * never re-proposed — so one bad patch would lose a good community for good.
 *
