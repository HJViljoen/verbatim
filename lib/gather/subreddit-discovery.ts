// But a proposal is not a decision: GPT knows which subreddits plausibly exist
// for a category and is confidently wrong about whether they carry the client's
// customers. So this step only ever produces a SHORTLIST TO TEST; the live
// relevance probe (step 2) is what promotes a candidate to 'active'.
//
// That split is the Poler/Patagonia lesson made structural — the failure there
// was trusting a name at face value ("Patagonia" the brand vs the region), and a
// model proposing r/Patagonia for an outdoor brand would repeat it exactly.
